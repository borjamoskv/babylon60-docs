## Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/borjamoskv/Cortex-Persist.git
cd Cortex-Persist
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

---

## Verify Installation

```bash
cortex --version
# cortex-persist, version 0.3.0b2
```

---

## First Steps

```bash
# Initialize the database
cortex init

# Check system health
cortex status

# Store your first fact
cortex store my-project "Redis uses skip lists for sorted sets" --tags "redis,data-structures"
```

This creates the database at `~/.cortex/cortex.db` with the full schema (facts, transactions, embeddings, consensus, and more).

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

- Notifications use `osascript` (Notification Center)
- Daemon installs as a `launchd` agent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`)
- Native Keychain integration via `pyobjc`

### Linux

- Notifications use `notify-send` (libnotify)
- Daemon installs as a `systemd` user service (`~/.config/systemd/user/`)
- No root/sudo required

### Windows

- Notifications use PowerShell Toast
- Daemon installs as a Task Scheduler job (triggered at logon)
- Compatible with WSL2 for development

See [Cross-Platform Guide](cross_platform_guide.md) for full architecture details.
