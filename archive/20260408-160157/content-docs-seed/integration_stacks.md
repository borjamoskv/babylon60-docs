Adopting cryptographic memory doesn't mean ripping out your existing infrastructure. CORTEX is designed to sit alongside your current vector databases and orchestration frameworks, wrapping your final state mutations in a **Verification Membrane**.

## 1. Architectural Position

CORTEX acts as the *Source of Truth* (Layer 3) for decisions, distinct from your *Working Memory* (Layer 1) and your *Semantic Matcher* (Layer 2). You **do not** replace Qdrant or Pinecone. You add CORTEX specifically for verifiable actions and core identity facts.

## 2. Integration with Major Orchestrators

CORTEX Persist provides out-of-the-box MCP (Model Context Protocol) compatibility. It can be integrated directly into any modern multi-agent environment with minimal lines of code.

### Using AutoGen or LangGraph

For an orchestration pipeline heavily reliant on Python:

```python
from cortex import CortexEngine
import asyncio

async def orchestrate_decision(context: str, agent_name: str):
    engine = CortexEngine()
    
    # After standard LLM logic concludes...
    # Store the irreversible outcome in the CORTEX Ledger
    receipt = await engine.store_fact(
        content=f"Decision reached: {context}",
        fact_type="task_outcome",
        project="swarm-alpha",
        tenant_id="client-007"
    )
    
    # You now have the cryptographic receipt for downstream compliance
    print(f"Secured with hash: {receipt.hash}")
```

### Flow via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

If you are using Anthropic tools or anything compatible with the MCP spec, CORTEX ships a native `mcp/` server:

```bash
# Start the standard trust MCP bridge
$ cortex mcp trust --port 8080

# Or boot the Aether MCP variant
$ cortex mcp aether --port 8080
```

Agents can now query `verify_record` or `store_fact` directly as external tools, providing total autonomy without needing the Python SDK inside your orchestrator container.

## 3. What changes in your workflow?

1. **You stop using Vector DBs for logs.** Ephemeral RAG data stays in your semantic vector store. Critical decisions, API calls, tool uses, and core facts move to the CORTEX ledger.
2. **You add Guards to API paths.** CORTEX requires inputs to pass validation boundaries—preventing an agent's hallucination from becoming permanent memory.
3. **You export rather than explain.** Instead of digging through Datadog to explain to stakeholders why an agent sent an email, you export the exact `cortex verify` cryptographic receipt.
