## Purpose: The Doctrinal Formula

> **CORTEX-Persist no confía en outputs.**
> La probabilidad puede sugerir. Solo la verificación puede gobernar.

This document defines the trust boundaries, guarantees, non-guarantees, and verification surfaces of CORTEX Persist.

The fundamental problem of modern AI agents is not that they hallucinate; it is that their probabilistic output is granted ontological status before being verified. **We do not build systems that trust the model. We build systems where unverified probabilistic output cannot survive long enough to matter.** CORTEX treats all generative output as *thermodynamically unstable conjecture* (`Void-State`).

CORTEX is not secure because it stores data. CORTEX is secure to the extent that it constrains who may mutate state, under which conditions, forcing probabilistic suggestions to cross a deterministic admission pipeline—formal schema validation, cryptographic ledger inscription, and causal taint tracking—before becoming actionable memory.

## Security Posture

CORTEX assumes that non-trivial inputs may be malformed, deceptive, stale,
contradictory, or adversarial.

This includes:

- human input
- agent input
- upstream model output
- tool return values
- external API responses
- replayed or duplicated facts
- semantically valid but operationally dangerous content

Generative outputs are treated as proposals, not trusted state.

## Trust Boundary

The core trust boundary is the write path.

A proposal may only become durable state after crossing deterministic controls:

```text
proposal
  → guards
  → schema/type validation
  → policy/admission checks
  → encryption
  → ledger/audit recording
  → persistence
```

If any required control fails, the write aborts.

---

## Security Goals

CORTEX aims to provide:

- durable auditability of write behavior
- cryptographic continuity across facts
- encrypted storage of sensitive fact content and metadata
- tenant-aware data isolation
- deterministic rejection of structurally invalid inputs
- explicit validation boundaries between stochastic proposals and durable state
- inspectable failure rather than silent permissiveness

---

## Guarantees

CORTEX is designed to guarantee, within correct implementation and deployment:

### 1. Cryptographic Traceability

Persisted facts participate in a ledger continuity model through hash linking.

### 2. Encrypted At-Rest Storage

Sensitive content and metadata are encrypted before persistence.

### 3. Auditable Write Path

State mutation is expected to emit audit-relevant trace or log data.

### 4. Deterministic Structural Rejection

Inputs that fail required syntax, type, schema, or guard conditions should be rejected.

### 5. Tenant-Aware Isolation

Data operations are expected to preserve tenant boundary semantics.

### 6. Failure Locality

Invalid proposals should fail before contaminating downstream durable state.

---

## Non-Guarantees

CORTEX does not guarantee:

- semantic truth
- correctness of external models
- safety of upstream tools or providers
- correctness of external APIs
- absence of malicious intent in upstream sources
- correctness of business logic added outside trust boundaries
- safety if callers bypass guards, policy, or verification surfaces
- magical immunity from bad architecture layered above it

A cryptographically logged lie is still a lie. It is merely an auditable lie.

---

## Trust-Surface Threat Model

Representative threats include:

### Prompt / Instruction Injection

Inputs attempt to coerce the system into bypassing intended policy or semantics.

### Contradictory State Insertion

Inputs attempt to create durable memory that conflicts with validated prior state.

### Dependency Contamination

Proposal depends on false, stale, or unverifiable upstream assumptions.

### Silent Schema Drift

A change in structure weakens invariants without obvious runtime failure.

### Ledger Integrity Break

Hash continuity becomes invalid through bug, corruption, or unreviewed mutation.

### Replay / Duplication

Previously accepted facts are reintroduced in a way that degrades retrieval or
alters interpretation.

### Cross-Tenant Leakage

Data path accidentally leaks or merges tenant state.

### Async Safety Failure

Blocking or cancellation bugs produce state inconsistency or partial operations.

---

## Defense in Depth

CORTEX relies on layered control, not a single magic wall.

### Guards Layer

Examples include:

- contradiction guard
- dependency guard
- injection-detection and input-hardening controls

These operate before persistence and are intended to reject invalid or dangerous proposals.

### Policy / Gate Layer

Admission control and policy evaluation determine whether a write is even allowed
under the current actor, tenant, or environment.

### Crypto Layer

Encryption protects sensitive fact content and metadata at rest.

### Ledger Layer

Hash chaining provides continuity and tamper-evidence characteristics.

### Audit Layer

Audit records preserve post-hoc inspectability of critical mutations.

### Verification Layer

Formal or deterministic verifiers can be used where applicable to validate
invariants or reject invalid state transitions.

---

## Verification Membrane

The verification membrane is the boundary between generative uncertainty and
durable system state.

```text
LLM / tool proposal
  → guard validation
  → schema / type checks
  → policy gate
  → external verification where required
  → cryptographic logging
  → persistence
```

The membrane exists to convert unconstrained suggestion into constrained mutation.

---

## Ledger Integrity

`cortex/ledger.py` (`SovereignLedger`) is the canonical trust surface. Other modules (`consensus/ledger.py`, `memory/ledger.py`, `cli/ledger.py`) are re-export bridges or domain-specific wrappers — all chain integrity flows through the canonical module.

Its purpose is not branding. Its purpose is continuity.

### Required Properties

- append-like continuity semantics
- deterministic hash derivation behavior
- stable verification path
- test coverage for continuity assumptions
- explicit review for any change affecting link formation or verification

### Practical Rule

If a change can break historical verifiability, it is not a normal refactor.
It is a trust event.

---

## Encryption Model

Fact content and meta are encrypted at rest.

### Operational Meaning

- sensitive payloads must not be stored plaintext
- decryption occurs on authorized read path
- key handling must remain externalized and controlled
- secrets must not be reintroduced unencrypted into secondary stores

### Practical Rule (Encryption)

"Encrypted primary store + plaintext side channel" is not security. It is cosplay.

---

## Tenant Isolation

All new data operations should be tenant-aware by default.

### Risks

- implicit defaulting in unsafe contexts
- missing filters in read/search paths
- merged indexing or caching across tenant surfaces
- admin tooling that assumes single-tenant world state

### Expectation

Isolation must be explicit in APIs, search, caching, and persistence behavior.

---

## Audit Trails

The audit system exists for:

- forensic reconstruction
- compliance evidence
- mutation traceability
- incident investigation
- operational trust

Auditability is not a substitute for correctness.
It is the condition that makes correctness failures inspectable.

---

## Compliance Posture

CORTEX positions audit trails, decision traceability, and deterministic validation
as foundations for regulated AI environments, including EU AI Act-adjacent needs.

This should be stated carefully.

**Correct Claim:**
"The system is designed to support traceability, auditability, and constrained
state mutation."

**Weak Claim:**
"The system is compliant because we said 'compliance' near some hashes."

Compliance is not a vibe. It is evidence.

## Failure Domains

Critical failure domains include:

- write-path validation
- ledger integrity
- migrations
- tenant isolation
- async transactional correctness
- policy bypass
- index consistency
- external provider misclassification or drift

These domains deserve explicit review before release.

---

## Release Review Checklist for Trust Surfaces

Before release, review:

- guard behavior changes
- ledger continuity changes
- encryption path changes
- policy/gate changes
- migration safety
- tenant isolation behavior
- async cancellation/timeout behavior
- audit event completeness
- API surfaces that can mutate state

---

## Guiding Rule

CORTEX does not make models truthful.
It reduces their freedom to contaminate persistent state.
