description: "CORTEX Persist Documentation — Thermodynamic Enforcement (Axiom Ω₁₃)"

**Status:** Operational  
**Objective:** Encode physical and informational limits into system primitives to prevent unbounded stochastic drift and guarantee verifiable knowledge compaction.

This document freezes the operational contract of the Thermodynamic Enforcement suite. All changes to the modules listed here must strictly preserve these invariants. If tests fail against these properties, the system enters an uncontrolled entropic regime.

## 1. Causal Gap (Search / Indexing)
**Module:** `cortex.search.causal_gap`

**Inputs:**
- Target `CausalGap` (hypothesis, expected evidence, current confidence)
- Corpus of `SearchCandidate` objects (semantic score, evidence match logic)

**Outputs:**
- Ordered list of candidates ranked by `final_score`.

**Invariants & Ranges:**
- `semantic_score` ∈ `[0.0, 1.0]`
- `evidence_match_score` ∈ `[0.0, 1.0]`
- Return order must strictly be descending by `final_score`.
- **Property 1**: Exact evidence matches must monotonically increase (or stabilize) the score compared to purely semantic matches.
- **Property 2**: An empty corpus must immediately return an empty list without exceptions.

## 2. Epistemic Taint (Causality Graph)
**Module:** `cortex.engine.causality`

**Inputs:**
- Invalidated/Penalized `source_fact_id`
- Async causal graph state

**Outputs:**
- `TaintReport` containing affected count and discrete confidence downgrades.

**Invariants & Ranges:**
- Confidences follow the exact ordinal sequence: `["C5", "C4", "C3", "C2", "C1"]`.
- `new_confidence` ≤ `old_confidence` (Confidence floor is C1).
- **Property 1**: Taint introduced upstream MUST NEVER increase effective downstream trust.
- **Property 2**: The depth of the propagation (hops) monotonically increases the applied degradation penalty.
- **Property 3**: Invalidating a node with no descendants must yield an empty report safely.

## 3. Immune Metastability (Health & Stability)
**Module:** `cortex.immune.metastability`

**Inputs:**
- History of `SystemEvent`

**Outputs:**
- `MetastabilityReport` containing status (`healthy`, `dormant`, `metastable`, `chaotic`) and risk metrics.

**Invariants & Ranges:**
- `risk_score` ∈ `[0.0, 1.0]`
- `monoculture_ratio` ∈ `[0.0, 1.0]`
- **Property 1**: Idempotency — Equivalent input histories MUST produce identical deterministic outputs.
- **Property 2**: Non-decreasing Risk — Appending recent failures MUST NOT decrease the `risk_score`.
- **Property 3**: Monoculture Penalization — A higher similarity between event types strictly degrades the health status.

## 4. Shannon Exergy (Information Compaction)
**Module:** `cortex.shannon.exergy` and `cortex.shannon.analyzer`

**Inputs:**
- Abstract distributions of events/knowledge vs expected weights
- Empirical generation variables: tokens spent, compression ratio, noise fraction.

**Outputs:**
- `ExergyReport`, `exergy_score`, `exergy_ratio`, `dead_weight`

**Invariants & Ranges:**
- `exergy_score` ∈ `[0.0, 1.0]` (unless constrained exceptionally by noise offsets)
- `exergy_ratio` ∈ `[0.0, 1.0]`
- `dead_weight` ≥ `0.0`
- `tokens_spent` > `0` strictly.
- **Property 1**: Division Safety — Empty inputs or `0` token expenditure must fallback deterministically or raise explicitly.
- **Property 2**: Inverse Noise Correlation — Holding utility constant, increasing `noise_fraction` must monotonically decrease the final score.
- **Property 3**: Utility limits — Ornamental usage (high volume, low downstream utility) must strictly rank lower than compact utility.
